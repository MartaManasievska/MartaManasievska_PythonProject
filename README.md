# Life Simulation Game 🎮

A character-driven life simulation game built with Python. This project allows players to create a character, choose their gender, pick a career path, and make choices that shape their character's future. The game was built as part of a personal learning journey to practice modular Python programming, logic trees, and basic game design.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive character creation (male or female)
- Career selection with branching decision trees
- Morale and performance tracking
- Randomized events that affect gameplay
- Modular code structure for easier understanding and maintenance

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies)

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Strengthen understanding of Python functions, classes, and modules
- Practice logical flow and decision branching
- Explore basic storytelling through code
- Develop a clean, organized codebase using multiple scripts
